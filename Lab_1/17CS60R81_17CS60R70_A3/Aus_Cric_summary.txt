Australia's bruising and protracted cricket pay dispute was finally resolved on Thursday with players and management agreeing on a new "in-principle" deal, ensuring upcoming series against Bangladesh, India and England can go ahead.
The players appeared to be the winners in the five-year agreement, worth an estimated Aus 500 million ($396 million), as they retained the revenue-sharing model they had been fighting for -- with women cricketers also included for the first time.
"It will allow all players -- state and international players -- to be contracted immediately and it will also allow the all-important tour of Bangladesh to proceed as planned." At the heart of the dispute had been the divisive issue of revenue-sharing.
Players have been paid a percentage of gross revenue for the past two decades, and they argued that changing the system would make them employees rather than partners with incentives to grow the game.
Under the new deal, they will share up to 30 percent of agreed revenue -- 27.5 percent of forecast revenue streams, and a 2.5 percent performance pool.
In a significant move, the format will also apply to female players in what the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) said was "the biggest pay rise in the history of women's sport in Australia".
"One MOU for men and women, the maintenance of the partnership model, and record investments for grassroots cricket is what we wanted and it's what has been achieved." Steve Smith can now lead his team to Dhaka on August 18 with their futures secured.
An Australian A tour to South Africa in June was called off after players announced a boycott, and Sutherland admitted relationships within the game had been "tested".
